# Missed Connections
I was having a tough week but although not particularly involved, I will briefly highlight a few things I went out of my way to do:
- reaching out to friends I haven't connected with in a while
- hanging with my co-worker outside of work
- reaching out to old coworkers I haven't seen in a while

I also wanted to capture this thought I had somewhere:
Going skiing and then deciding that was the "right call" when I was worried about making the "wrong decision" of how to spend my weekend is not the manifestation of the "right decision", however it is the natural follow through of there being no "wrong call"

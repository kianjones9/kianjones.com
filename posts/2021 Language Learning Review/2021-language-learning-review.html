					trying to do since high school: make at least some progress in learning a foreign language.</p>
				<p id="d11804df-df91-43ec-8a21-d1ee382aa9d9" class="">I think what finally allowed me to do this was
					having my career in a good place, and being able to justify for once in my, deprioritizing my career
					in favour of other interests or passions. Don't get me wrong! I am still putting in the effort to
					meet my self-imposed success criteria with school work, it's just that so far, that hasn't required
					so much time that it encroaches on my efforts in other places in my life.</p>

				<p id="1637b978-228f-46cd-baf2-5feeea2f6b3d" class="">I had previously tried and failed at learning
					several languages, including but not limited to Swedish, Farsi, Arabic, and Korean, but never with
					much success. With this new found time to commit to my pursuit of multilingualism, I reviewed the

				<p id="7d2e0197-6ff8-461f-a1c1-963975256090" class="">To decide, I looked inside myself and examined my
					own motivation for learning languages. I found I cared a lot more about actually conversing with
					native speakers, hearing their stories, telling them mine, etc. That's why I chose Arabic! I have a
					storied history with Arabic speakers, including friends from high school, ex-girlfriends, and my
					college roommate. In fact, the city I live in has so many Arab residents, the area around my high
					school is literally called <a

				<p id="ed875f5f-5325-45e1-b1db-df36652b132b" class="">Canada tends to have a lot of Arab immigrants
					based on having French as an official language, and many Arab countries having had a significant
					French language influence. For instance, in the case of Syria and Lebanon, the <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandate_for_Syria_and_the_Lebanon">Mandate for Syria and
						Lebanon</a>, established by the League of Nations.</p>
				<p id="d9e154e3-d9fc-4b34-ab05-21eb3b66b56f" class="">The mass immigration of the Lebanese specifically
					occurred during the Lebanese civil war. <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Canadians">Wikipedia says</a>:</p>
				<p id="f4b8bfb7-b530-4b98-be9a-2acefec6e1a2" class="">The greatest influx of Lebanese was during
					the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990), and this period saw a number of Lebanon's wealthiest and
					best educated move to Canada to flee the violence in their homeland. Canada and Australia were the
					only Western countries to set up special programs to enable Lebanese to more easily emigrate. Canada
					set up an office in Cyprus to process Lebanese refugees.</p>

						fantastic report</a> looking at the 2011 Census statistics and reporting insights regarding the
					Canadian-Arab community in the Ottawa-Gatineau region (among other things). </p>
				<p id="0efe2f42-5c12-4e9f-a521-be9b869c6533" class="">This report lists Ottawa-Gatineau as the 3rd
					largest population of those self-identifying as Canadian Arab, accounting for 10% of Canadian-Arabs.
					In fact, those self-identifying as Canadian-Arab constitute 6% of the population of Ottawa-Gatineau.
				</p>
				<p id="974df6e0-1f64-4bd8-9f3b-4f660b6f1657" class="">I hope it's clear that in Ottawa, Arabic would be
					a language in which I could often speak with native speakers. I'll remind you, this is a major point
					of interest and motivation for me. Thus I decided i would learn Arabic!</p>

				<h2 id="5e570d71-0b64-4fae-9387-61756cde8ea1" class="">Learning Arabic: Meta Learning</h2>
				<p id="5f25c119-48ad-4415-9950-2894dbf6d31a" class="">In Scott Young's book <em>Ultra-learning</em>, he
					describes the concept of learning <em>about</em> how to learn a subject as "meta-learning". Some
					must be spent to learn how to most effectively learn a subject. For me, this meant learning a lot of
					Arabic speaking countries, the Arabic that is spoken there, and the culture, as well as finding
					resources to learn from.</p>
				<h3 id="79da1bf5-c680-456a-8409-6d1b01930582" class="">Dialect Due Diligence</h3>
				<p id="29fcf97d-8762-4d01-8102-30fbc6186f97" class="">If you are unaware, Arabic is a language with many
					dialects. Arabs typically learn the colloquial dialect of Arabic spoken in their country at home,
					and then learn Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) at school. Arabs speaking different colloquial dialects
					may have some understanding of each other depending on the similarities of their dialects (whose
					even to say where you draw the line between dialects), but would typically choose to communicate in
					MSA. MSA is used in literature, academia, mass media, legislation, etc. so it is often perceived as
					less authentic and raw and sounds more formal.</p>
				<p id="908c2a6b-7b2a-434c-ba84-01968076c665" class="">The general consensus is that you should learn
					both if you really want to be fluent and communicate effectively, since there is a need to know both
					to fully embrace the culture, communicate with others, and consume content from the Arab world etc.
					For example, there would be an Egyptian movie, where the dialogue is in the Egyptian dialect, but if
					you chose to enable subtitles, you'd find they are written in MSA!</p>
				<p id="03172316-8c97-46e5-bd2f-d3dac45a5b1c" class="">As a language learner, you have to choose to begin
					studying either MSA, or a colloquial dialect (Okay you could do it at the same time but let's not go
					there). Most learners typically begin with MSA, and then pick up a more localized dialect later.
					They often choose Egyptian because Egypt produces a lot of the media in the Arab world, in
					particular, movies are often in the Egyptian dialect. Most Arabs have at least some understanding of
					the Egyptian dialect because of its prevalence in film. Thus if you are an Arabic learner, you can
					probably get the best bang for your buck with Egyptian Arabic.</p>
				<p id="5fe30882-0782-4de6-8e0b-03e4a1b5b046" class="">However, in recent years, there has been a rising
					popularity among Arabic learners, in starting your journey with a dialect, and then moving on to
					MSA, similar to how actual Arabs would learn. </p>
				<p id="625a8e99-0cb7-45b8-8175-f8e6a727c8a7" class="">When I reviewed my motivations for learning, I
					realized my primary goal wasn't to read Arab news, or watch Egyptian films, but to talk with people.
					To make real human connections with native speakers.</p>
				<p id="6ae66c34-a312-4052-b59c-ed2d35605e99" class="">So which dialect would best facilitate
					conversations between me and native speakers? Well, take a look at the population of different Arab
					diaspora in Ottawa:</p>

				</div>
				<p id="7185759b-02b3-4065-b2ee-2f1cf2265c01" class="">In case it isn't obvious, I decided to learn the
					Levantine dialect, which is spoken in Lebanon and Syria, Palestine, and Jordan.</p>
				<p id="7f165f10-5518-479a-9764-514c5db02503" class="">Growing up in Ottawa, I know of so many Arabic
					speakers who can help me in my journey, and they are disproportionately Lebanese! </p>
				<h3 id="0f18e41c-8e59-40fd-a375-6d7ce6a0db2a" class="">Resource Research</h3>
				<p id="f53cb056-221e-4a68-a7e2-4cfe62cd4515" class="">When I was first beginning my Arabic studies I
					used the Mango Languages app, which is in my opinion the best language learning app I've used! It's
					a paid service that almost anyone can get access to for free through their school, local library,
					etc.</p>
				<div class="image-interrupt image-interrupt-horizontal">
					<img src="2021 Language Learning Review/Untitled%201.png"/> 
				</div> 
				</figure>
				<p id="d0531d98-45b2-49d9-b5a9-2e469fc0f824" class="">Mango's app utilizes colour to show word-for-word
					translations, and gives you lots of repetition for each phrase. It also has very high quality audio,
					given in different voices (helps with oral comprehension).</p>
				<p id="2a8bf7aa-d0a0-49d9-abca-06f9c787e4cb" class="">Once I decided to get serious and really commit, I
					diversified my learning resources.</p>
				<p id="9d3bbaed-0df8-40c4-8de8-a39d178b9bf1" class="">Specifically I committed to introducing <em>at
						least</em> 20 new cards per day in Anki (and reviewing old cards of course). I used <a
						href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/133807911">this Anki deck</a> which has been pretty good
					in terms of its consistency (just make sure you sort the cards in the order you want to learn them,
					i.e. first by tag:Basic, then tag:Advanced. <a
						href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/k8vpcm/comment/gf31znf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">Reddit
						post on how to order cards</a>.</p>
				<p id="8cd5bf64-4fbd-4c71-9819-ee107890f4fd" class="">I also ordered <a
						href="http://thriftbooks.com/w/eastern-arabic_majed-f-said_frank-a-rice/1190184/">this textbook
						on Thriftbooks.com</a>. Although the vocabulary is transliterated and outdated, it's been
					excellent for learning Grammar. It covers plenty of topics, including some really nuanced concepts
					like certain pronunciations, consonant clusters, etc. as well as the standard verb conjugation,
					pluralization, etc.</p>
				<p id="63aef107-c886-4482-aa58-85d9f18e15a1" class="">Most of my speaking practice has been with my
					teacher on <a href="http://italki.com">Italki</a>.</p>
				<p id="ecdf2732-1ca0-4ec2-8fb0-57e5c3d50603" class="">Additionally, recently I have been using <a
						href="http://lingq.com">Lingq</a>. It's also a paid service, but in my opinion this cost is
					justified since they have written content in the Levantine dialect. I haven't used it too long, but
					I definitely enjoy it so far.</p>
				<h2 id="07374bd5-26e1-41fd-9de1-ad70afad09a7" class="">Now the Good Stuff: The Data!</h2>
				<p id="d318b4bb-9f0d-4f10-a62b-ba66e4531296" class="">I tracked my progress learning Arabic over the
					last few months, tracking the time I spent working on different activities. I definitely foresee a
					future blog post discussing time tracking, especially as it pertains to language learning, so keep
					an eye out for that. I also have some stats automatically collected from Anki, but that might be a
					follow up post.</p>
				<p id="92ee5e36-0062-415e-8a8f-77d1f293ebbd" class="">After I got serious (final week of August) and I
					had been studying for a couple months, I decided to give myself a goal. I decided I wanted to reach
					150 hours of study by the end of 2021. I had some progress prior to setting that goal, but it worked
					out to about an hour a day (128 more hours in 130 days). I ended up getting Covid during the last
					week of the year, so I only hit 140 hours, but still proud of this accomplishment nevertheless.</p>
				<h3 id="512f9ae6-a3d1-4cdd-b04f-66b4eaed3743" class="">Time spent by Activity</h3>
				<p id="50402ae8-4f95-4181-97a3-84e42af7502e" class="">I tracked my time in an application called <a
						href="http://track.toggl.com">toggl</a>, where I would log how much time I spent doing different
					activities. I didn't make too great an effort to track the times at which I was studying. This was a
					conscious choice, since even something as little as that can make me give up on something like this.
					I wanted to make this as easy as possible to start doing.</p>
				<p id="dd5a6946-cd74-4251-a18a-a8ecefc48560" class="">First, I graphed the total time I spent studying,
					grouped by activity, to view how much time I spent doing each activity.</p>

					towards long-term goals without obvious short-term progress. But if I can continue for 57 days,
					almost 2 months, without keeping up with the pace I've set for myself, but ultimately end up in the
					same place, then next time I start to fall behind in my short-term goals, I won't feel nearly as
					disappointed, or demotivated. A true testament to the power of consistency.</p>
